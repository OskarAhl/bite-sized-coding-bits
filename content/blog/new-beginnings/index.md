Thunks are not scary, it's one of the fancy words programmers like to throw around but once you get to the essence of it it's really not that complicated.

Read the text, do the excersises, and you'll have a basic understanding of thunks in no time. Then you'll be able will to understand your co-workers (and streams and libraries such as redux-thunk).

### "Thunk the expression"

When you speak with another programmer they might say "Thunk the expression". What does this mean? Thunks are a way to avoid unneccessary computations. An unnecessary computation is e.g. a function that is called when it's not needed, with thunks you can delay the evaluation until the it's actually needed. This is known as **lazy evaluation**.

So a thunk is an expression that has not been evaluated yet. A thunk is represented by a function that has been declared. When the function is called the function is evaluated, so evaluation of functions only happen when the function itself is called.

**What's an expression?**

Expression is a statement of logic. E.g: a function declaration:

```javascript
const add = (a, b) => a + b
```

<br />

**What's evaluation?**

Evaluation is when a piece of code is executed. The add function above has been declared -- but it has not been executed yet. To evaluate or to execute the function, we call it:

```javascript
add(39, 3)
```

### Streams:

With a stream you can generate an infinite sequence of values. Since the stream can generate an infinite amount of values you cannot call a function and "create" all the infinite values at once.

By using thunks you can create an infinite sequence of values -- since a thunk is not evaluated immediately.

A basic stream can be represented by a function that returns a pair: a value and a thunk that will generate the next value:

```
[value, thunkToGenerateNextValue]
```

<br />

**What's a pair?**

A pair is a datastructure that holds two values. JavaScript doesn't have an innate pair datastructure so we can simply use an array with two values to make our own pair datastructure.

```javascript
const pair = [value1, value2]
// we can access pair values with [0] and [1]
```

<br />

Implementation of a stream that generates an infinite sequence of ones:

```javascript
const streamOfOnes = () => [1, streamOfOnes]

// usage:
streamOfOnes()[0] // 1
streamOfOnes()[1]()[0] // 1
streamOfOnes()[1]()[1]()[0] // 1
//...amazing, we can generate infinite 1's on demand / lazily!
```

<br/>

Stream of ones returns the value 1 and a thunk to generate the next value (and next thunk that can generate the next value...).

To generate the next value of the stream we call the thunk (the second element in the pairs array) returned by our streamOfOnes function.

The thunk here is the streamOfOnes function declaration, that we recursively return as a thunk.

Here is another one: a stream that counts from 1:

```javascript
const countStream = () => {
  // takes the current count and increments it by one
  const counterHelper = count => [count, () => counterHelper(count + 1)]

  // start counting from 1
  return counterHelper(1)
}

console.log(countStream()[0]) // 1
console.log(countStream()[1]()[0]) // 2
console.log(countStream()[1]()[1]()[0]) // 3
```

<br />

Your turn! Complete the function below and once it passes all tests move on to the next:

### Let's get functional

Good job so far! ðŸŽ‰

This challenge is more challenging ðŸ˜‰. Currently to get values from a stream we are accessing the thunk in the array and calling it repeteadly, which is hard to read and hard to follow.

e.g:

```javascript
// this is hard to follow:
countStream()[1]()[1]()[0]
```

<br />

What if there was an easier way?

You're up again captain!
